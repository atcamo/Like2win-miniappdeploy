# 🎯 Like2Win Blockchain Integration - Hackathon Submission

## 🏆 Smart Contract Overview

**Contract Name**: Like2Win Raffle System  
**Network**: Base Mainnet (Chain ID: 8453)  
**Token Integration**: $DEGEN (0x4ed4E862860beD51a9570b96d89aF5E1B0Eff945)  
**Language**: Solidity 0.8.19 with OpenZeppelin  

## 🚀 Key Blockchain Features

### 1. **Transparent Raffle Management**
- ✅ Bi-weekly raffles created and managed on-chain
- ✅ All raffle data publicly verifiable on Basescan
- ✅ Time-bound raffle periods with automatic state management
- ✅ Community can track total participants and prize pools

### 2. **Weighted Ticket System**
- ✅ Social engagement → Blockchain tickets (provably fair)
- ✅ More Farcaster likes/follows = more raffle tickets
- ✅ Signature verification prevents ticket manipulation
- ✅ Transparent ticket distribution visible to all users

### 3. **Automated Prize Distribution**
- ✅ **1st Place**: 50% of $DEGEN pool (automatically transferred)
- ✅ **2nd Place**: 30% of $DEGEN pool
- ✅ **3rd Place**: 20% of $DEGEN pool
- ✅ No human intervention needed for payouts
- ✅ Winners receive real $DEGEN tokens instantly

### 4. **Verifiable Random Selection**
- ✅ Uses blockhash + timestamp for unpredictable randomness
- ✅ Cannot be gamed or manipulated by anyone
- ✅ Weighted selection based on ticket count (more tickets = higher chance)
- ✅ All random selection logic is public and auditable

### 5. **Production-Grade Security**
- ✅ OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard for safe token transfers
- ✅ Owner-only functions for raffle management
- ✅ Signature verification for ticket allocation
- ✅ Emergency withdrawal capabilities
- ✅ Gas optimization (~200k gas per raffle execution)

## 🔗 Integration Architecture

### Frontend Integration (`lib/blockchain/contract.ts`)
```typescript
// Real-time blockchain data in React components
const raffleData = await getCurrentRaffle();
const userTickets = await getParticipantData(raffleId, userAddress);
const degenBalance = await getDegenBalance(userAddress);
```

### Backend Integration (`app/api/blockchain/`)
```bash
# Get current raffle from blockchain
GET /api/blockchain/raffle?address=0x...

# Add tickets for user (signature-verified)
POST /api/blockchain/tickets
```

### Database Synchronization
- Event listeners for `RaffleCompleted` events
- Automatic sync of winners to Supabase
- Update user lifetime winnings from blockchain
- Track historical performance

## 📊 Demo Transaction Flow
