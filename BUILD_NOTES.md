# Build Notes

## Current Status
- ✅ **Development mode works**: `bun run dev` functions correctly
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation**: No type errors with `bunx tsc --noEmit`
- ✅ **Turbopack mode**: `bunx next dev --turbo` works without issues
- ⚠️ **Production build**: `bun run build` has timeout/performance issues

## Issues Encountered
- Build process hangs during optimization phase
- All TypeScript errors have been resolved
- Neynar API integration works correctly in development

## Workaround
For development and testing, use:
```bash
bun run dev
# or for faster compilation:
bunx next dev --turbo
```

## API Status
- ✅ Follow detection: Working with real Neynar API
- ✅ Cast fetching: Real Like2Win posts 
- ✅ Engagement checking: Actual like/recast verification
- ✅ Development mode: No database dependency required

## Next Steps
- Consider optimizing build configuration
- Monitor memory usage during build
- Test deployment with alternative build strategies
